The goal of the Rogue project is to build an AI to play Magic: The Gathering at a better-than-human level.

The initial goal is to develop similar functionality as https://github.com/andrewljohnson/CardAI while making it run faster.

## Running Hello World

From the `rogue` directory:

```
go install ./...
play
```

You should see it print "Hello world!"
